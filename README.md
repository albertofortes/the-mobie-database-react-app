# ReactJS + Redux + The Movie Db API experiment

This is a weekend experiment/excercise to work with [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
The original idea was to do a website to check in which platform we can see movies or TV shows. For example, the user searchs for "Thi is Us" and the website returns a list of items searched, when the user select the one he choose, the specific movie page will show all the significative data and the platform (Amazon).

Sadly, the only API I found that provide this information is not free and is too much expensive for this kind of excercise, so finally I decided to do the same project but withput platform information.

As this is an excercise, I only did Movies available, maybe one day I will easily add TV shows.

I used: SCSS, React JS, Redux, Web Font Loader.
